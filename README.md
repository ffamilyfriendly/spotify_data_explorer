# Spotify Data Explorer

> This is a simple CLI application meant to allow you to explore your streaming history on spotify. For this to work you need to request your streaming data from spotify. You can do so [in your privacy settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/). As of right now this project is very WIP and a lot of values are hardcoded.
